<p>Welcome to the USCIS GitHub.com environment!  The GitHub.com service has been selected to be a Pilot as a Source Code Management (SCM) tool for multiple teams within the USCIS. Each team will use repositories within GitHub.com to manage and store both their source code and supporting documentation.  By using GitHub.com we look to increase efficiency and promote a more collaborative environment throughout each team’s project lifecycle.</p>
